**DjangoGirls BlogSite Tutorial**

This project follows the DjangoGirls tutorial, with some additional work for the LightBird calendar tutorial in a separate branch. 

Personal note: The Lightbird tutorial is great as a workflow template, but some of the code really sucks. Also, it was not helped by having hard-coded absolute pathnames in the examples. I think it was written several Django versions ago, which explains some of the howlers, but there are other parts which simply do not, to my mind, seem very Pythonic.
